    <p>
    My primary research interest lies in Partial Differential Equations. I work on prolems related to stability of solutions of certain PDEs. PDEs, I have worked with so far, are all models of waves on a water surface. I am also interested in predictions of characteristics of tropical cyclones as it is closely related to shallow water wave models. I use models of machine learning in conjuction with PDEs describing tropical cyclone phenomena to get these predictions. I am also interested in some theoretical aspects of machine learning and its applications in Biology. In addition, I am also involved in some projects in Game Theory and Number Theory. For more details, please look at full lists of publications and preprints below.
